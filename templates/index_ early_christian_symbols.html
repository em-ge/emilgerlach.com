      Early Christian Symbols and Their Meanings
    </h1>
    <p class="normal-text">
      In the early centuries of Christianity, open faith often came with serious risks. 
      Christians were a minority and frequently persecuted for their beliefs.
      To stay connected and express their identity, they used simple symbols—drawn in the sand, 
      carved into walls, or worn as signs of quiet conviction. 
      These images weren’t just codes; they carried deep meaning and helped early believers hold on to hope, share their faith, and recognize one another in uncertain times. 
      The following symbols played a central role in this silent language of faith.
    </p>

    <div class="sub-heading">
      <h2 id="ichthys">Ichthys (The Fish)</h2>
    </div> 
    <p class="normal-text">
      The fish symbol, known as Ichthys, was one of the earliest and most recognizable signs of Christianity. 
      The Greek word ΙΧΘΥΣ served as an acronym for Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior. It was often used in secret to identify fellow believers.
    </p>

    <div class="sub-heading">
      <h2 id="chi-rho">Chi-Rho (The Christ Monogram)</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="normal-text">
      The Chi-Rho combines the first two letters of the Greek word Christos (Χ and Ρ). 
      This monogram symbolized Christ and was a bold statement of faith, later adopted by the Roman Emperor Constantine.
    </p>

    <div class="sub-heading">
      <h2 id="anchor">The Anchor</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="normal-text">
      The anchor symbolized hope, safety, and steadfastness in faith. 
      For early Christians, it also represented the promise of salvation through Christ and was often used in tombs and inscriptions.
    </p>

    <div class="sub-heading">
      <h2 id="shepherd">The Good Shepherd</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="normal-text">
      This image showed Christ as a shepherd carrying a lamb on his shoulders. 
      It symbolized Jesus' care, guidance, and sacrificial love for his followers. It was especially popular in early Christian art and catacomb paintings.
    </p>

    <div class="sub-heading">
      <h2 id="dove">The Dove</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="normal-text">
      Representing the Holy Spirit, the dove often appeared in scenes of Jesus’ baptism or symbolized peace and purity. 
      It was a powerful reminder of God's presence and guidance.
    </p>

    <div class="sub-heading">
      <h2 id="lamb">The Lamb</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="normal-text">
      The lamb stood for Christ as the sacrificial "Lamb of God." 
      It reflected Jesus' role in taking away the sins of the world and was a central symbol in early Christian theology.
    </p>
    
    <div class="sub-heading">
      <h2 id="alpha-omega">Alpha and Omega</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="normal-text">
      These two Greek letters, the first and the last of the alphabet, symbolized God as the beginning and the end of all things. They expressed the eternal nature and sovereignty of Christ.
    </p>

      These two Greek letters, the first and the last of the alphabet, symbolized God as the beginning and the end of all things. They expressed the eternal nature and sovereignty of Christ.
